#Electricity Usage Visualization Project

This project plots electricity usage data from an example CSV file and makes observations about the detected categorical usage.  
This was prepared an interactive cover letter for a job post by [Plotwatt](https://plotwatt.com)

In this work, I explored the following concepts and tools:  
- jquery File loading
- jquery-csv CSV parsing
- canvasjs Javascript plotting
- Skeleton responsive CSS template
- Javascript arrays and objects
